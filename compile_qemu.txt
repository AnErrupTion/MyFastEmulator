These are the instructions on how to build QEMU for MyFastEmulator v2.

First, you want to get the appropriate version of QEMU that MFE v2 uses (for example, v5.0). You can download the sources on the official QEMU website (qemu.org).
Then, extract the folder from the compressed file.
Now, cd into that directory :

$ cd qemu-X.X.X

Where X are the version numbers.
Now, you'll need to install all required dependencies to build QEMU :

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libvte-2.91-dev libspice-server-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libcap-ng-dev libattr1-dev libaio-dev

After that, use the configure file to enable required features for MFE v2 :

$ sudo ./configure --enable-sdl --enable-opengl --enable-virglrenderer --enable-system --enable-modules --audio-drv-list=pa --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-kvm --enable-guest-agent --enable-gtk --enable-curses --enable-vte --enable-libusb --enable-virtfs --enable-spice --enable-linux-aio

And then, build QEMU using the make command (here we'll use all available CPU cores for faster building) :

$ sudo make -j$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo)

The only thing you'll need to do is put the QEMU folder into your home directory, then rename the folder to "qemu-mfe" (without quotes).
Congratulations! You can now launch MFE v2 with (normally) no problems! :D
